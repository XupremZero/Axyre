#Axyre Library - Created by Samuel Alonso

	Purpose of this library - Redefining and expanding the STL in C/C++, trying to get the max performance and portability as
	possible. We gonna use the GCC compiler, OGL/D3D(X)/OGLES/VK to create a graphics abstraction, C keywords and features, 
	C++11 keywords(such as template, constexpr, etc...), OS dependencies (Memory allocation, Input, GUI, Stream Files, Network, etc...),
	the header <cstdint> to get a perfect size variables types and not depend on the OS to define them with whatever size they want to.
